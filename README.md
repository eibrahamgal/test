# Distributed System Simulation

This project simulates a distributed system where nodes reach consensus on a shared state using a simple consensus algorithm. The system handles network partitions and node failures gracefully.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Run `rails db:migrate` to set up the database.

## Running the Simulation

Run the Rails console to interact with the nodes and simulate different scenarios.

```bash
rails console
